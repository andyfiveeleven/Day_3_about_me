            I'm a Minnesota boy born and raised, I spent most of my childhood running around outside, playing with legos, cooking with my mom, and building stuff with my dad. I've had sharp knives and tools in my hands from an early age, and I thoroughly believe that you need the right tools to get a job done right. No dull knives, no dull tools, no dull websites

            I migrated out to Washington to persue my love of rain, pine trees, mountains and a little school called Whitman College. I spent my time there studying sociology and film (with a healthy does of theatrical carpentry and event planning.) After graudation, I moved to Seattle to persue the only logical outcome of a sociology and film degree, software.

            In my free time you'll probably find me in my kitchen, my woodshop, or out in the woods.

          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>
            My background is focused in software sales and carpentry. Those skills are surprisingly useful when building a product for a client. I love diving into a client's needs, assessing their pain points and use cases, and delivering a solution tailored to them. Carpentry tought me how to work on a product with very little client instruction. Sales taught me how to get the needed information about a client's needs in a 5 minute conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I pride myself on my ability to deliver a product thats perfect for every client, and understand the needs of the end user.
